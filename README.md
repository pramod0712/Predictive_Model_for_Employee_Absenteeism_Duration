The project aims to develop a predictive model to anticipate the duration of employee absenteeism based on a set of personal and work-related attributes. Leveraging machine learning techniques, including classification algorithms, the model analyzes factors such as employee demographics (e.g., age), family circumstances (e.g., number of children, pet ownership), travel distance, and reason for leave. These features serve as predictors for determining whether an employee is likely to be absent for more than three hours or less.

The model's objective is twofold: first, to assist companies in proactively managing absenteeism by identifying high-risk individuals who may be prone to prolonged absence; and second, to provide insights into the underlying factors influencing absenteeism patterns within the organization. By accurately predicting absenteeism duration, companies can implement targeted interventions, such as flexible work arrangements, health and wellness programs, or workload adjustments, to mitigate potential disruptions and foster a more productive work environment.
